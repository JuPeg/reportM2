            "text": "Introduction\n\n\nThe next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, also known as high-throughput sequencing, have developped very fast in the past few years. Between the most known technologies there are Illumina, Roche 454 and SOLiD. These platforms are able to produce over billions of short read data every day. This huge amount of data at lower costs enables deep sequencing and enlarge the application possibilities. [^EMBL-EBI]\n\n\nThese technologies can, for example, aid the study of metagenomics and the understanding of the host-pathogen interactions. [^Gausson]\n\n\nViruses present a high diversity in which concern their genomes. Single or double-stranded, RNA or DNA, linear or circular, as well as different types of replication cycles, intermediates and strategies can hamper viral sequencing and detection. For instance, viruses with no DNA stage can not be detected by DNA sequencing and viruses without poly-A tails are not detected by most mRNA sequencing protocols. [^Kreuze][^Carissimo]\n\n\nAttempting to avoid this issue and knowing that NGS technologies are suitable for small RNA sequencing, Kreuze \net al.\n proposed in 2009 to use vsiRNA as a solution to virus identification. This approach would enable the identification of virus in low concentration as well as new virus with no prior information. [^Kreuze]\n\n\nRNA interference (RNAi) is one of the mechanisms used by plants and invertebrates in gene expression control. Besides silencing endogenous genes, this process is also a potent antiviral pathway. Its main enzyme is called Dicer, which recognises viral RNA. This RNA molecule is then cleaved in smaller RNA duplex called virus-derived small RNA (vsiRNA). [^Sabin] According to previous studies about Dicer's substract, different forms of viral RNA may be a vsiRNA precursor: double-strand RNA (dsRNA) as well as regions in highly structured hairpin in simple-strand RNA (ssRNA) or messenger RNA (mRNA). DNA virus are also directly identified and cleaved by Dicer enzymes. However, ssRNA virus must be transformed in dsRNA before Dicer recognition. [^Aliyari]\n\n\nAccording to Gausson and Saleh, vsiRNA molecules indicate the activation of the antiviral response in the host and its abundance reveals the degree of viral replication and gene expression. [^Gausson] Though vsiRNA molecules have a characterisc length (varying from 21 to 23 nucleotides according to the host), the cleavages distribution in the viral genome remains unclear: some virus are cleaved in limited regions while others are targeted through the whole genome. [^Gausson][^Sabin]\n\n\nMapping these small molecules against a reference viral genome can give informations about the nature and the structure of the viral dsRNA. Moreover, as viral genomes evolve fast, it is important to know and identify viral variants for biological and medical researches. It can be conveniently done by scaffolding vsiRNA short sequences into a known similar reference sequence. [^Gausson][^Vodovar]\n\n\nIntenting to determine viral variants, Vodovar \net al.\n proposed \nPaparazzi\n, a perl script that aims to reconstitute a virus complete genome from vsiRNA and an initial reference sequence as scaffold thanks to an iterative algorithm. The script was tested with small RNA sequencing data from \nDrosophila melanogaster\n infected with \nNora virus\n. The study showed that the improved sequence had a higher coverage when compared with the initial \nNora virus\n reference genome. [^Vodovar] With the same goal, SearchSmallRNA is a software developed in java that uses a similar approch. [^Andrade] \n\n\nHowever, both SearchSmallRNA and Paparazzi present the same combination of cons. At first, they demand some computer skills from users for installation and execution. Secondly, they require a close enough sequence to serve as reference for guiding the algorithm. This preclude the identification of new or unexpected viruses. Lastly, these programs are not currently available for download.\n\n\nAiming to release a software able to detect and reconstruct viral genomes from NGS datasets without the problems mentioned above, ARTbio developed Metavisitor, a free and open source set of Galaxy tools and workflows. \n\n\n\n\n[^Ikegami]: Ikegami T, Inatsugi T, Kojima I, Umemura M, Hagiwara H, Machida M, et al.

Many reasons can lead a sequence to be undesired in the viral reference database, essentially we want all of them to be informative and to have a human readable header. We studied the retrieved sequences for both databases. Besides some commom filters, they have also their particularities which are explained next.\n\n\nNucleotide database\n\n\nThe nucleotide database, also called \nnuccore\n, includes all sequence data from GenBank, EMBL (European Molecular Biology Laboratory) and DDBJ (DNA Data Bank of Japan). It also contains the Reference Sequences (RefSeq) and nucleotide sequences extracted from structure records from the Protein Databank (PDB).\n\n\nThe Entrez query with new filters proposed for the Nucleotide database is the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatent\n\n\nNot only most patent sequences are extremely short (below 100 nucleotides), but also they are predominantly redundant with non-patent sequences. Besides, their title are almost always not representing the source organism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnverified\n\n\nUnverified sequences are sequences marked by GenBank staff as containning issues. In fact Genbank staff are reponsible for verifying the sequences and annotations accuracies. When they can not do it, the sequence is tagged as \"UNVERIFIED\" in its title until the submitter resolves the problems. These sequences are not included in the BLAST database and they should neither be included in the viral reference database. [^Genbank]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimeric\n\n\nChimeric sequences are hybrids between two or more different organisms. Only a few vir1 sequences are chimeric. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVector\n\n\nA vector is a tool used in molecular biology to deliver genetic material into another cell. They are genetically engeneered from viral or cellular genetic material. Entries containing this word in the title usually present artificial sequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n\n\nSome NCBI entries concern methods for molecular and cellular biology. Their title do not indicate what the sequence is neither its source. There is always some better anottated sequence for the same source organism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncultured virus\n\n\nSome sequences present \"uncultured virus\" as their source organism, which does not inform much about the sequence origin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLength\n\n\nNCBI contains many viral sequences below 100 nucleotides. These sequences are simutaneously not much informative and quite redundant with the rest of the database. They would increase the processing resources needs without adding results.\n\n\nThe Entrez query syntax for defining the Sequences LENgth (SLEN) requires high and low thresholds. So, we define a high threshold that is certainly going to embrace every viral sequence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor reasons that are going to be explained afterwards, we will have to retrieve nucleotide sequences in two separated sets. The first datasets will contain only RefSeq entries that will be picked by adding the filter \nAND RefSeq[Filter]\n. The second includes only non-RefSeq entries which means a \nNOT RefSeq[Filter]\n must be added in the Entrez query.  \n\n\nProtein database\n\n\nThe protein database contains sequences from Protein Information Resource (PIR), UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and Protein Research Foundation (PRF) as well as amino acid sequences obtained from the coding regions from all nucleotide records also included in Nuccore.\n\n\nFor the protein dataase, the proposed Entrez query with filter is the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnverified\n\n\nFor the same reasons as explained for the nucleotide dataset, unverified sequences are excluded from the reference dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirus-like particles (VLP)\n\n\nAs described by Brand\u00e3o \net al.\n, VLPs \"are multiprotein structures that mimic the organization and the conformation of authentic native viruses but lack the viral genome\". They are used in different fields,  as vaccines, gene therapy and viral protein studies. Since they are not genuine viruses, they are not reference sequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimeric\n\n\nFor the same reason as the nucleotide database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVector\n\n\nFor the same reason as the nucleotide database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n\n\nFor the same reason as the nucleotide database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLength\n\n\nThe thresholds chosen for nucleotide sequences are not convinient for proteins. Protein sequences are shorter. We will consider that the shorter significative sequence has at least 30 amino acids, which is just a bit shorter than the correspondent minimum of 100 nucleotides. To comprise the longest sequences, the high threshold is defined at 10000 amino acids. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe protein sequences are also separated in two datasets. The first one, comprising data from curated databases (RefSeq, SwissProt, PIR and PDB), will be retrieved with the extra filter \nAND (RefSeq[Filter] OR SwissProt[Filter] OR PIR[Filter] OR PDB[Filter])\n. The remaining data belongs to the second set adding to the query: \nNOT (RefSeq[Filter] OR SwissProt[Filter] OR PIR[Filter] OR PDB[Filter])\n.\n\n\nRetrieve FASTA from NCBI\n tool\n\n\nFor retrieving the sequences from NCBI according to the chosen Entrez query, we use a Galaxy tool developed in python and called \nRetrieve FASTA from NCBI\n. This tool uses the Entrez Programming Utilities (\nE-utilities\n) which offers a stable interface connection into the Entrez query and the NCBI databases. \n\n\nAfter connecting with the chosen database (nuccore or protein) and retrieving the sequences by batches, this tool also sanitazes the data by formatting the header and skipping problematic sequences. The skiped sequences are either empty or contain ambiguous nucleotides.\n\n\n\n\n[^Genbank]: Benson, D. A., Karsch-Mizrachi, I., Clark, K., Lipman, D. J., Ostell, J., \n Sayers, E. W. (2012).
