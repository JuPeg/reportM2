                <p>Once the sequences have been retrieved using the Entrez queries described before, the cluster step can get started. Indeed, the data retrieved is still very redundant. </p>
<p>Obviously, redundancy in biological data is not a novelty. Thus, there are a list of tools already developed aiming to reduce or resolve this problem. The question being what software is the best adapted to our scenario.</p>
<p>Besides the big amount of data available, another issue with clustering sequences is that to compute distances between elements, sequences alignments are required. Biological sequences present deletions, insertions and mutations what makes it quite complex to determine the distances between every sequence. Besides, the sequences length will impact significantly in the time processing required. To reduce this problem, some algorithm found alternatives for calculating pairwise distance wisely. </p>
<p>There are two main types of sequence clustering algorthms for biological sequences. They are discussed below:</p>
<h1 id="hierarchical-clustering">Hierarchical Clustering</h1>
<p>Hierarchical clustering algorithms are applied in many different data fields. Most of them have quadratic space and computation complexities (<em>O</em>(n<sup>2</sup>)), which means that the complexity grows quadratically with the number of elements in the dataset. This implies a data size limitation too restrictive for our case. [^Cai] </p>
<h2 id="esprit-tree">ESPRIT-Tree</h2>
<p>Some new algorithms propose methods for reducing its complexity and the processing time. It is the case of ESPRIT-Tree, a recent hierarchical clustering algorithm that uses the concept of space partition. Unlike most hierarchical clustering algorithms, ESPRIT-Tree does not build a distance matrix, every distance is calculated as needed. It uses a "devide-and-conquer-based strategy" which assures a quasilinear complexity. All the informations about ESPRIT-Tree algorithm and particularities are described in its paper <a href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/05/19/nar.gkr349.full.pdf+html"><em>ESPRIT-Tree: Hierarchical clustering analysis of millions of 16S rRNA pyrosequences in quasilinear computational time</em> (Cai &amp; Sun)</a>.</p>
<p>The software clusters the elements within a pseudometric based partition (PBP) tree, a tree that contains multiple levels uniformly spaced in a logarithmic scale. It is built incrementally by adding sequence by sequence in the tree. For each new sequence, its distance to the center of existing nodes will determine its position. If this pairwise distance is greater than a given threshold, a new node is created. Else, the sequence is absorbed inside the node and it is compared with the nodes in the lower level. This process repeats until the new sequences reaches the leafs level. Another new sequence will then be added in the PBP tree. To avoid the risk of overlapping the clusters hyperspaces, the software opts by adding the new sequence within the first cluster matching the condition, instead of the closest cluster. This step complexity is on the order of <em>O</em>(N).</p>
<p>Then, this tree needs to be refined so the closest pairs of clusters are groupped together. A naive calculation of distances between every pair of cluster to determine the minima takes <em>O</em>(N<sup>2</sup>) operations. However, thanks to the PBP tree, nearest neighbor sequences can be found locally since they are always in the same or adjacent cluster spaces. Taking this advantage, the minimal distances can be found in <em>O</em>(log N) time and <em>O</em>(N) space using pseudometric space triangular inequalities.</p>
<p>Another improvement implemented by ESPRIT-Tree concerns the paiwise distance calculation. As said before, computing distances between sequences is a lot more mathematically challenging than the distances between numeric-valued vectors. When comparing sequences with different lengths, an alignment is needed. ESPRIT-Tree uses probabilistic sequences to facilitate the task. A probabilistic sequence is a statistical model that describes a group of sequences. These virtual sequences are aligned using the probabilistic Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, a generalizaton of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. Thanks to this algorithm, pairwise distances will be calculated as an approximation of the probabilistic average distance between two probabilistic sequences.</p>
<p>To reduce the workload required for doing all the alignements, ESPRIT-Tree also uses the <em>k</em>-mer distances strategy. With this method it is possible to avoid many unnecessary alignments in the PBP tree construction and in the clustering refinement. This technique will be discussed in the CD-HIT section.</p>
<p>According to ESPRIT-Tree official <a href="http://plaza.ufl.edu/sunyijun/ES-Tree.htm">website</a>, the software is being optimized and a beta version is available upon request.</p>
<h1 id="greedy-heuristic-clustering">Greedy Heuristic Clustering</h1>
<p>Greedy heuristic clustering are another approach used to cluster sequences. Two of the most used algorithms are CD-HIT and UCLUST. As greedy algorithms, they try to approximate the global optimal solution in a reasonable time comsuption. These algorithms are mostly faster than hierarchical clustering algorithms, but they tend to be less accurate. </p>
<p>The input sequences are processed sequentially by the algorithm. Already treated sequences can be of two types: representative or redundant. Redundant sequences are illustrated by representative sequences, so, they can be excluded from further analyzes. Every new sequence is compared with the representative sequences. If the pairwise distance is smaller than a given threshold, than the new sequence is considered redundant. Otherwise, it is a representative sequence that will be part of following analyzes.</p>
<p>The process described is a  is is the main process followed by this class of clustering algorithms. However, different software presents particularities in its methods and definitions. This differences will be detailed below.</p>
<p>Overall, these algorithms' computational complexity is on the order of <em>O</em>(NM), where N indicates the number of sequences in the input and M is the number of representative sequences. Therefore, their resources consuption is quite hard to predict since the data redundancy may be unknown until the algorithm is run.</p>
<!--Though, this is just a simplification as it does not take into account the sequences length.-->

<h2 id="cd-hit">CD-HIT</h2>
<p>Originally developped to protein sequences clustering in 2001, this software was extended for nucleotides sequences in 2006. The algorithm supporting nucleotides clustering received the name CD-HIT-EST. CD-HIT package also includes many other programs and perl scripts used to compare two databases, identify overlapping reads, etc. Since 2012, CD-HIT can run in multiple-thread, reducing the database size limitations.[^Li] CD-HIT's informations were retrieved from its <a href="https://github.com/weizhongli/cdhit/blob/master/doc/cdhit-user-guide.wiki">user's guide</a>. </p>
<p>CD-HIT's algorithm starts by ordering the sequences from the longest to the shortest. The longest sequence is automatically a representative sequence. Then, as explained before, every other sequence will be classified as redundant or representative accordig to the sequences already classified as representative. The user can choose if redundant sequences should go to the first matching cluster (fast mode) or to the closest cluster after comparison with all representative sequences (accurate mode).</p>
<p>One of the principal heuristics used by CD-HIT is the short word or <em>k</em>-mer filter. A short word or <em>k</em>-mer is is a small sequence of <em>k</em> nucleotides (for DNAs) or amino acids (for proteins) that is used in many situations to accelerate some computational processes. Every sequence contains L-k+1 <em>k</em>-mers which can repeat over the sequence. There are 4<sup><em>k</em></sup> possible unique <em>k</em>-mers in nucleotide sequences and 20<sup><em>k</em></sup> in proteins using the standard amino acid alphabet.</p>
<p>The insight with <em>k</em>-mers in alignement methods is that there is a correlation between the quantity of common <em>k</em>-mers in different sequences and the identity between them. So, following previous studies of real alignments, they were able to determine statistically the common <em>k</em>-mers distribution according to the sequence lengths and identities.</p>
<p>CD-HIT uses <em>k</em> from 2 to 5 for proteins and from 8 to 12 for DNAs. These values represent an amount of unique <em>k</em>-mers that can be stored in computer memory.</p>
