ARTbio
=====

The *Institut de Biologie Paris Seine* (IBPS) was created in January 2014 in the Jussieu Campus within the *Universit√© Pierre et Marie Curie* (UPMC). Its main goal is to bring together all the biology researches developed in the campus aiming to become the UPMC's biology flagship.

In september 2015, ARTbio, a bioinformatics platform, was created within IBPS. Targeting the **A**ccessibility, **R**eproducibility and **T**ransparency in computational **bio**logy, the team offers support and analyses services for scientists in the UPMC and elsewhere. For doing so, ARTbio works with the Galaxy system, an open source and web-based platform dedicated to scientific and biomedical research. The Galaxy project proposes a user-friendly interface where everyone would be able to run one's own computational data analyses as well as reproduce and share complete analyses. 

Thanks to Galaxy, ARTbio is able to involve biologists in their computational analyses. Besides realising their computational analyses, other types of services are available, as assisting the experimental and computational analyses and providing advanced training in Galaxy usage. 

Additionally, ARTbio provides two Galaxy instances: [Mississippi](http://mississippi.fr) and [Plastisipi](http://lbcd41.snv.jussieu.fr) which are available for autonomous users for free. These instances are maintained by the team, that also develops and adapt tools to the Galaxy environment.

In the Galaxy system, tools can be organised by purpose in suites of tools. ARTbio has made publicly available a suite of tools called [Mississipi toolsuite](https://testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/mvdbeek/mississippi_toolsuite/) for mining mi, si and pi RNA sequencing datasets. Another suite of tools, [suite_visitor2](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repository?repository_id=5f04ea49dce00916) was recently released followed by a [BioRxiv preprint](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/048983).
