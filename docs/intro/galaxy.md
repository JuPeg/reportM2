#Galaxy#

Galaxy is an open-source platform used for many types of computational analyse in the biomedical fields. Originally developed for genomics research, Galaxy provides tools for many other disciplines in the life sciences. 

A free public server is kept by the Galaxy team, but many other instances are also available. Any organization or user can install their own Galaxy instance adapted for their particular needs. Thereby, a regular user, with no particular computer skills, is apt to realize data analyses in one these instances.
